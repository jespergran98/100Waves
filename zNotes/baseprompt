I am creating a professional top-down zombie survival game using React, TypeScript, and Vite with modern best practices. The project follows clean folder structure standards. Use CSS variables from global.css for all styling. The website must be fully responsive with a clean, modern design and simple logic. Always provide complete file contents for any modified or new files. The design must be in the highest tier of web developement, while keeping the code clean, streamlined, structured and perfect.

Current project structure:

```
100Waves/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   └── assets/
│
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── MainMenu/
│   │       ├── MainMenu.css/
│   │       └── MainMenu.tsx/
│   │
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── global.css
│   └── main.jsx
│
├── .gitignore
├── eslint.config.js
├── index.html
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── vite.config.ts
```

Follow this structure and deliver clean, production-ready code using modern React, TypeScript, and Vite patterns. Maintain component-based architecture, and type safety throughout. Your task is to follow this context, respect the aesthetic, and deliver solutions that follow modern React, JavaScript, and Vite best practices while...
