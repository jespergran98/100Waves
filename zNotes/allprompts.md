I am creating a professional top-down pixelated zombie survival game using React, TypeScript, and Vite with modern best practices. The project follows clean folder structure standards. Use CSS variables from global.css for all styling. The website must be fully responsive with a clean, modern design and simple logic. Always provide complete file contents for any modified or new files. The design must be in the highest tier of web developement, while keeping the code clean, streamlined, structured and perfect.

Current project structure:

```
100Waves/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   └── assets/
│
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── global.css
│   └── main.jsx
│
├── .gitignore
├── eslint.config.js
├── index.html
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── vite.config.ts
```

Follow this structure and deliver clean, production-ready code using modern React, TypeScript, and Vite patterns. Maintain component-based architecture, and type safety throughout. Your task is to follow this context, respect the aesthetic, and deliver solutions that follow modern React, JavaScript, and Vite best practices while creating the main menu component. The main menu consists of three buttons:
Play
Settings
Quit

It has a satisfying background, that provides the player with a stunning pixelated zombie survival design before starting the game.

Your task is to follow this context, respect the aesthetic, and deliver solutions that follow modern React, JavaScript, and Vite best practices while creating a seed file and add it to the project where it makes sense. The seed file is a simple logic that generates at the start of each game. The seed will affect various aspects of the game, such as the map layout, spawns, RNG for different elements and more.
