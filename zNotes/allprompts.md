I am creating a professional top-down pixelated zombie survival game using React, TypeScript, and Vite with modern best practices. The project follows clean folder structure standards. Use CSS variables from global.css for all styling. The website must be fully responsive with a clean, modern design and simple logic. Always provide complete file contents for any modified or new files. The design must be in the highest tier of web developement, while keeping the code clean, streamlined, structured and perfect.

Current project structure:

```
100Waves/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   └── assets/
│
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── global.css
│   └── main.jsx
│
├── .gitignore
├── eslint.config.js
├── index.html
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── vite.config.ts
```

Follow this structure and deliver clean, production-ready code using modern React, TypeScript, and Vite patterns. Maintain component-based architecture, and type safety throughout. Your task is to follow this context, respect the aesthetic, and deliver solutions that follow modern React, JavaScript, and Vite best practices while creating the main menu component. The main menu consists of three buttons:
Play
Settings
Quit

It has a satisfying background, that provides the player with a stunning pixelated zombie survival design before starting the game.

Your task is to follow this context, respect the aesthetic, and deliver solutions that follow modern React, JavaScript, and Vite best practices while creating a seed file and add it to the project where it makes sense. The seed file is a simple logic that generates at the start of each game. The seed will affect various aspects of the game, such as the map layout, spawns, RNG for different elements and more.

Your task is to follow this context, respect the aesthetic, and deliver solutions that follow modern React, JavaScript, and Vite best practices while ensuring world generation logic is efficient and scalable. The generation that is currently hard should be the world generating for easy mode, and default and hard should be made much harder. (It's way too much grass on easy mode currently). Be creative and ensure the map is perfect for a top down zombie survival game.

Your task is to follow this context, respect the aesthetic, and deliver solutions that follow modern React, JavaScript, and Vite best practices while ensuring high performance and responsiveness and increasing the map size, instead of 64x64, it should keep expanding as new areas load into the screen. The camera should be much more zoomed in. (Make sure the map isnt infinitely generating, but genrates just before entering the screen)
