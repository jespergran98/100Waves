I am creating a professional top-down pixelated zombie survival game using React, TypeScript, and Vite with modern best practices. The project follows clean folder structure standards. Use CSS variables from global.css for all styling. The website must be fully responsive with a clean, modern design and simple logic. Always provide complete file contents for any modified or new files. The design must be in the highest tier of web developement, while keeping the code clean, streamlined, structured and perfect.

Current project structure:

```
100Waves/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   └── assets/
│
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── global.css
│   └── main.jsx
│
├── .gitignore
├── eslint.config.js
├── index.html
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── vite.config.ts
```

Follow this structure and deliver clean, production-ready code using modern React, TypeScript, and Vite patterns. Maintain component-based architecture, and type safety throughout. Your task is to follow this context, respect the aesthetic, and deliver solutions that follow modern React, JavaScript, and Vite best practices while creating the main menu component. THE COMPONENT CONSISTS OF A TSX AND A CSS FILE. The main menu consists of three buttons:
Play
Settings
Quit

It has a satisfying background, that provides the player with a stunning pixelated zombie survival design before starting the game.

It should look extremely professional for my top down zombie survival game. Act as a senior web developer and deliver the best code possible. PROVIDE THE UPDATED MainMenu tsx and css file. It should be simplistic, elegant, and use CSS variables from global.css for all styling. Improve the subtle animations and hover effects on the buttons to enhance user experience while keeping the design minimalistic and clean.
